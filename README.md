## About This Project

When you deploy a new version of your solution, you cannot use normal fields to carry information such as version numbers, build numbers, or timestamps. These will be overwritten during data migration. Normally, a calculation field would do the trick; however, setting their values manually as part of your deployment pipeline or routine is not suitable for modern CI/CD scenarios.



## How Does It Work?

We use a serial number field in a global table to store json in the next serial value, and, yes!, since 'everything in Filemaker is text' it is possible to store in this place not only a number but a very large json text with all the data you need. 

This works natively without any plugins, and you can store as much data as you'll need.

After data migration, all fields contain the 'old' values from your previous production file. Upon opening the file, we perform a quick check of the fieldâ€™s ModCount by querying the internal FileMaker_Fields table. As the ModCount changes every time you set new build information, a new version will be detected in the script, and the information will be extracted by creating a temporary new record. All this happens only once for every release.
